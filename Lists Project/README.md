Assignment 4: SkipList
Goals: Working with dynamic arrays, pointers, doubly linked lists
For this assignment, you will write a Skip List data structure to store integers. When searching a
Skip List, items can be found in O(log n) time. No duplicates are allowed.
A SkipList can have multiple levels. SkipList of depth 1 is similar to a doubly linked list. All
elements are inserted into a single doubly linked list.
When a SkipListhas multiple levels, all elements are inserted at level = 0. 50% of those
inserted at level = 0, are also inserted at level = 1. 50% of those inserted at level = 1 are also
inserted at level = 2, and so on.
There are multiple different types of implementations of Skip List data structure that you might
find on the internet, make sure you are following the assignment specifications.

The above picture shows a SkipList with a depth of 5, Level-0 to Level-4
At L0, all items are inserted: 10, 15, 35, 70, 120
Some of those items (based on a coin toss, 50% chance using (rand() % 2) == 1) are
inserted at level = 1, i.e. at L1. Some of those items are inserted at L2, and so on.
SkipList has front and rear guards, in our case INT_MIN and INT_MAX as the first and the
last items at each of the levels. This makes it easier to add and find items.
Skip List is made up of private SNode elements. Each SNode has SNode* of next, prev,
upLevel and downLevel, as well as data which holds the actual integer value stored at the
node.
front and rear guards are special SNode* objects to make the implementation easier. The
pointers to these guards are kept in arrays, named frontGuards and rearGuards, see
below for details.
The public functions of SkipList are:
// default SkipList has depth of 1, just one doubly-linked list
explicit SkipList(int depth = 1);
// destructor
virtual ~SkipList();
// return true if successfully added, no duplicates
bool Add(int data);
// return true if successfully removed
bool Remove(int data);
// return true if found in SkipList
bool Contains(int data);
The private variables and functions of SkipList are:
class SNode {
public:
// SNoide stores int as data
explicit SNode(int data);
// data for SNode
int data;
// link to next SNode
SNode *next;
// link to prev SNode
SNode *prev;
// link to up one level
SNode *upLevel;
// link to down one level
SNode *downLevel;
};
// depth of SkipList, levels are 0 to depth-1
int depth;
// array of depth SNode* objects as frontGuards linking levels
// if depth = 2, we'd have frontGuards[0] and frontGuards[1]
SNode **frontGuards;
// array of depth SNode* objects as rearGuards linking levels
SNode **rearGuards;
// given a SNode, place it before the given NextNode
void addBefore(SNode *newNode, SNode *nextNode);
// return true 50% of time,
// each node has a 50% chance of being at higher level
bool alsoHigher() const;
};
The friend function is used to display all the elements of SkipList
friend ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const SkipList &list)
Make sure your implementation of operator<< matches the output provided below.
You may choose to have additional private functions as needed. The depth of the SkipList is
given in the constructor, so frontGuards and rearGuards will have to be dynamically allocated
arrays, using frontGuards = new SNode*[depth]; where the for level L0, the frontGuard
will be frontGuards[0] and rear guard frontGuards[0]
Constructor for SNode: set the data, set all other pointers to nullptr
SNode does not have any other functions. The data members of SNode are directly accessed
from SkipList.
Constructor for SkipList: Dynamically allocate frontGuards and rearGuards arrays, create the
special SNode* objects as guards, tie all the SNode objects together (both prev-next and
up-down)
SkipList::Add: return false if the given value is already in level-0. For initial insertion:
1. Set SNode*, such nextNode to be frontGuards[0]->next We know that
nothing can come before the ffrontGuards[0], so the nextNode from the
one we will insert should be at least frontGuards[0]->next
2. As long as nextNode->next is not null and nextNode->data < data, keep
moving nextNode to the right
3. If nextNode->data == data, return false stating duplicates are not allowed
4. If not, create a new SNode called newNode, put the data in it and call
addBefore(newNode, nextNode); to connect all the pointers together.
After inserting into level-0, toss a coin to check if it should be inserted at higher level. If inserting
at a higher level:
1. Create another node to be inserted at the higher level, newUpper
2. Connect newNode and newUpper (up-down)
3. Starting from newNode that was inserted, keep going back towards INT_MIN
until you find a node that has a valid upLevel link
4. Go up one level
5. Go right towards INT_MAX
6. Call addBefore to insert newUpper to come before the node you just got to
7. Set newNode to be newUpper
8. Toss a coin to decide if you need to insert it at a higher level again
SkipList::Contains: return true if the given value is in SkipList. You do not want to
search at level-0, that will be O(n), but you might want to start there as you build your program.
Assuming you are looking for value (to make the explanation easier and not to confuse it with
node data)
1. Start at top-left, highest level frontGuards[depth-1], let's call this node current
2. As long as current is not nullptr
a. Keep moving right as long as the current->next->data is less than value
b. If current->next->data is equal to value,
return true
else
set current to be the node down one level from current node
3. Go to step 2
4. If current is nullptr, the item is not in SkipList
SkipList::~SkipList: You will have to test your program under valgrind in CSS Linux Lab
to make sure there is no memory leak. For debugging purposes, you may also want to add a
static counter to increment/decrement SNode as it is getting created and deleted. You should
remove the static counter before submitting your program.
Make sure you delete each of the nodes at each level AND the dynamically allocated arrays
frontGuards and rearGuards.
When deleting an object, use delete objectPtr
When deleting an array, use delete[] array
Under unix, compile your code using
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra assignment4.cpp skiplist.cpp -o assignment4
You need to submit yourName_assignment4.zip with the following files in it. See course
assignments page for instructions on how to create it
skiplist.h - the prototypes of SkipList class functions
skiplist.cpp - the implementation of SkipList class functions
assignment4.cpp - extensive tests demonstrating working of SkipList with
different depths output.txt - See course assignments page for instructions on how to
create it selfassessment.txt - See course assignments page for the template
Tips and Hints:
● Get things working for Skiplist(1) with a depth of 1, there is only a single level to work
with. Make sure displaying, adding and contains works for this single level SkipList
before moving on.
● Use assert statements to confirm assumptions and stop execution of the program. For
example:
void SkipList::addBefore(SNode * newNode, SNode * nextNode) {
assert(newNode != nullptr && nextNode != nullptr &&
newNode->data < nextNode->data);
...
// after nodes have been linked
assert (newNode->next == nextNode &&
nextNode->prev == newNode);
assert (newNode->prev != nullptr &&
newNode->prev->data < newNode->data);
}
Sample debugging output, produced by:
void test04() {
SkipList s(5);
for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
int number = rand() % 100;
s.Add(number);
cout << "After adding " << number << endl;
cout << s << endl;
}
}
